# A* Pathfinding Visualization

This project visualizes the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm using Python's `SimpleGUICS2Pygame` library. It allows you to interactively input start and goal points on a grid and visualize the algorithm's process of finding the shortest path from the start to the goal, while avoiding obstacles.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Set a start and goal point within the grid.
- **A* Algorithm**: Implements the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid with obstacles.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Displays the grid and the pathfinding process step by step.
- **Feedback Messages**: Provides feedback on the current status, including error messages for invalid inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 2D Visualization**: `SimpleGUICS2Pygame` library for creating the GUI and rendering the grid.
- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm**: Heuristic search using Manhattan distance to find the shortest path.

## Requirements

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 2.x (tested with Python 2.7)
- `SimpleGUICS2Pygame` library

You can install `SimpleGUICS2Pygame` by downloading it from [here](https://simpleguics2pygame.readthedocs.io/)
